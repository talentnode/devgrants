# TalentNode Dev Grants

There are many talented individuals and teams that want to commit more time to working on their own open-source projects, as well as maintaining existing ones. However, unfortunately they are not able to gain access to financing that will allow them to do so. This is exactly why created TalentNode, a vehicle to finance open-source. Our platform's revenues are use to provide grants to developers.

## How the grants process works

Our goal is to reach a state where the grant process operates in a fully automated, autonomous, transparent, and decentralized manner. On our journey to reaching that state, we will be hosting the process via GitHub as outlined below. 

1. Projects submit proposals by creating an issue on talentnode/devgrants. The proposals are discussed in our community channels, and the community decides on their favorites. 

2. Each time that we announce a new grant, projects in the Issue pipeline that have passed the community screening stage can officially apply for funding. At this stage, the community carries out a binding vote, and the winner(s) is funded! The process is:

+ Fork the TalentNode Devgrants GitHub repository
+ Create a new directory with your projectâ€™s name inside the grants/ folder.
+ Inside that, create a file where you present your team, roadmap, and funding details. 
+ Create a Pull Request to merge your submission into the Devgrants repository.

## Announcement of grants

Grants are announced by TalentNode's core team through our community channels. We announce new grants each time we reach a new revenue milestone. As we are an open organization, we will publish our monthly financial results in the talentnode/open repository.

## How big are the grants?

The sizes of the grants depend entirely on TalentNode's performance. The more companies post jobs, the more grants we have available. Therefore, if you would like to help us on our mission to create sustainability for the open-source community, you can do so by spreading the word!

## Who can apply for grants?

For the time being, you are eligible to apply for a grant from anywhere in the world as long as you are able to issue an invoice to TalentNode as a freelancer or a business.
